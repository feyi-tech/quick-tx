NPM Script 1
"start-docker": "docker build -t feyitech-trade-bot ."

The command above tells docker to build an image tagged with the name "feyitech-trade-bot" which 
can be used to reference the image later in another command. 
The ".", meaning "the current directory", indicates the location of the Dockerfile to the docker app.


"run-docker": "docker run -d feyitech-trade-bot"

The command above tells docker to run the docker image tagged "feyitech-trade-bot" in “detached” mode (in the background)

The below command does the same thing with the above, except that it uses the -p flag to create a 
mapping between the host's port 3000 to the container’s port 3000

After a few seconds, opening a web browser to http://localhost:3000, the app should be seen.

"run-docker-port": "docker run -dp 3000:3000 feyitech-trade-bot"
